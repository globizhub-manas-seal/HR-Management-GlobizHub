## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v20+)
- npm or yarn
- Docker & Docker Compose (for easy database setup)

### 1. Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd hrms-backend-v1
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up your environment variables:
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (or create one) and ensure you fill in `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, and `SENTRY_DSN`.

4. Start the database (using Docker Compose from the root):
   ```bash
   cd ..
   docker-compose up -d db
   cd hrms-backend-v1
   ```

5. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma db push
   ```

6. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```
   The backend will be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 2. Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd hrms-project-v1
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env.local` file and configure your API URL:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 📦 Deployment (Production Readiness)

This repository includes a multi-stage `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for deploying the backend to production.
The CI/CD pipeline is configured via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to automatically lint and test code on pull requests.

For the frontend, it is heavily optimized for deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## 🔒 Security & Monitoring
- Ensure `SENTRY_DSN` is correctly configured in production for real-time error alerts.
- Structured JSON logging is enabled in production (via Pino) for easy aggregation.
- The NestJS backend is protected with `helmet` and strict CORS policies.
